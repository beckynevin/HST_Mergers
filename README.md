# HST_Mergers
I will update this, for now I've just dropped a broadband folder with one moment in time in the merger. The naming scheme is somewhat confusing - 'broadband_140.fits' roughly corresponds to Myr = 140. However, it is not exact.

I will include a short little .ipynb file for how to open and access the header of these files.

One resource if you are curious is the SUNRISE wiki - https://bitbucket.org/lutorm/sunrise/wiki/Home

It can tell you about the various extensions of this broadband file.
